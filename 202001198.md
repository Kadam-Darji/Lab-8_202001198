Created the test case to the class Boa

As we can see it added the BoaTest automatically.

Then changed the setUp() method in the BoaTest

Modified the testIsHealthy() to check the two objects.

The above is the result after running test runner.
The Pane is red because it failed the test case when the ken's length was greater than the cage size but was expecting true.

Now after changing the condition to false we get the green color.

Added the method to get the length in inches.
